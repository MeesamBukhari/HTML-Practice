    <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</h2>
    <p class="courses">Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing various industries with its ability to mimic human intelligence
        and perform complex tasks. AI is being applied in sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and 
        transportation. Machine learning algorithms enable AI systems to analyze large datasets, make predictions,
        and automate processes. AI-powered virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and personalized recommendations
        are just a few examples of how this technology is transforming our lives.</p>

    <h2>Internet of Things (IoT):</h2>
    <p class="courses">The Internet of Things refers to the network of interconnected devices embedded with sensors, software, and
        connectivity capabilities. IoT devices can collect and exchange data, enabling seamless communication between
        physical and digital systems. From smart homes to industrial automation, IoT is creating new possibilities 
        for efficiency, convenience, and productivity. It has the potential to enhance resource management, optimize
        energy usage, and improve healthcare monitoring, among other applications.</p>

    <h2>Blockchain Technology:</h2>
    <p class="courses">Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and secure way to store and verify digital transactions. It has
        gained popularity due to its applications in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its potential goes beyond 
        finance. Blockchain enables transparent and tamper-resistant record-keeping, making it useful in supply chain
        management, healthcare data exchange, and identity verification. It has the potential to streamline processes,
        enhance trust, and reduce fraud in various industries.</p>

    <h2>5G Connectivity:</h2>
    <p class="courses">The fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology promises faster speeds, lower latency, and increased network capacity
        compared to its predecessors. With 5G, we can expect ultra-high-definition streaming, real-time communication, 
        and seamless connectivity across devices. This technology will fuel advancements in autonomous vehicles, smart cities,
        virtual reality, and the Internet of Things. It has the potential to transform industries, improve productivity, 
        and enable innovative applications that require high-speed, low-latency connections.</p>

    <h2>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR):</h2>
    <p class="courses">AR and VR technologies provide immersive experiences by blending the real and virtual worlds. Augmented Reality 
        overlays digital information onto the physical environment, enhancing real-world interactions. Virtual Reality, 
        on the other hand, creates a simulated environment that users can explore through headsets or devices. Both 
        technologies have applications in gaming, entertainment, education, and training. They are also being used in 
        fields like architecture, healthcare, and remote collaboration to enhance visualization, training, and communication.</p>

    <h2>Quantum Computing:</h2>
    <p class="courses">Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information and perform calculations at 
        an unprecedented scale. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent data, quantum computers use quantum 
        bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Quantum computing has the potential to solve 
        complex problems much faster than classical computers, leading to advancements in fields such as cryptography, 
        drug discovery, optimization, and climate modeling. Although still in its early stages, quantum computing holds 
        immense promise for tackling complex challenges.</p>
